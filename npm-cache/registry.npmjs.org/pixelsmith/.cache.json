pixelsmith [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/pixelsmith.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/pixelsmith)\n\nNode based engine for [spritesmith][] built of top of [get-pixels][] and [save-pixels][].\n\n[spritesmith]: https://github.com/Ensighten/spritesmith\n[get-pixels]: https://github.com/mikolalysenko/get-pixels\n[save-pixels]: https://github.com/mikolalysenko/save-pixels\n\nThis can be used for constructing a canvas, placing images on it, and extracting the result image.\n\n## Getting Started\nInstall the module with: `npm install pixelsmith`\n\n```js\n// Load in our dependencies\nvar Pixelsmith = require('pixelsmith');\n\n// Create a new engine\nvar pixelsmith = new Pixelsmith();\n\n// Interpret some images from disk\npixelsmith.createImages(['img1.jpg', 'img2.png'], function handleImages (err, imgs) {\n  // If there was an error, throw it\n  if (err) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n\n  // We recieve images in the same order they were given\n  imgs[0].width; // 50 (pixels)\n  imgs[0].height; // 100 (pixels)\n\n  // Create a canvas that fits our images (200px wide, 300px tall)\n  var canvas = pixelsmith.createCanvas(200, 300);\n\n  // Add the images to our canvas (at x=0, y=0 and x=50, y=100 respectively)\n  canvas.addImage(imgs[0], 0, 0);\n  canvas.addImage(imgs[1], 50, 100);\n\n  // Export canvas to image\n  var resultStream = canvas['export']({format: 'png'});\n  resultStream; // Readable stream outputting PNG image of the canvas\n});\n```\n\n## Documentation\nThis module was built to the specification for spritesmith engines.\n\n**Specification version:** 2.0.0\n\nhttps://github.com/twolfson/spritesmith-engine-spec/tree/2.0.0\n\n### `engine.createImages(images, cb)`\nOur `createImages` methods supports the following types of images:\n\n- image `String` - Filepath to image\n- image `Object` - Vinyl object with buffer for image (uses buffer)\n- image `Object` - Vinyl object with stream for image (uses stream)\n- image `Object` - Vinyl object with `null` for image (reads buffer from provided filepath)\n\n### `canvas.export(options)`\nOur `export` method provides support for the following options:\n\n- options `Object`\n    - background `Number[]` - `rgba` array of value for background\n        - By default, the background is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` (transparent black)\n        - `[0]` - Red value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n        - `[1]` - Green value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n        - `[2]` - Blue value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n        - `[3]` - Alpha/transparency value for background\n            - Can range from 0 to 255\n    - quality `Number` - Optional quality percentage for JPEG images\n        - This value can range from 0 to 100\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint via `npm run lint` and test via `npm test`.\n\n## Donating\nSupport this project and [others by twolfson][gratipay] via [gratipay][].\n\n[![Support via Gratipay][gratipay-badge]][gratipay]\n\n[gratipay-badge]: https://cdn.rawgit.com/gratipay/gratipay-badge/2.x.x/dist/gratipay.png\n[gratipay]: https://www.gratipay.com/twolfson/\n\n## Unlicense\nAs of Nov 24 2014, Todd Wolfson has released this repository and its contents to the public domain.\n\nIt has been released under the [UNLICENSE][].\n\n[UNLICENSE]: UNLICENSE\n","maintainers":[{"name":"twolfson","email":"todd@twolfson.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-09-24T21:49:56.456Z","created":"2014-11-25T09:29:07.665Z","1.0.0":"2014-11-25T09:29:07.665Z","1.1.0":"2015-03-02T01:03:23.994Z","1.1.1":"2015-03-25T03:29:15.343Z","1.1.2":"2015-06-01T03:20:12.730Z","1.2.0":"2015-09-11T03:49:00.721Z","1.2.1":"2015-10-26T05:33:00.668Z","1.2.2":"2015-10-26T07:24:08.055Z","1.3.0":"2015-10-27T06:52:15.449Z","1.3.1":"2015-10-27T07:48:39.172Z","1.3.2":"2015-11-04T07:56:11.832Z","1.3.3":"2015-11-04T08:03:57.671Z","1.3.4":"2015-11-12T04:46:15.137Z","2.0.0":"2015-11-18T06:27:32.029Z","2.0.1":"2015-12-16T02:35:59.241Z","2.1.0":"2016-01-29T05:10:04.691Z","2.1.1":"2016-05-14T01:19:13.534Z","2.1.2":"2017-09-24T21:49:56.456Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/twolfson/pixelsmith","keywords":["spritesmith","image","spritesmith-engine"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/twolfson/pixelsmith.git"},"author":{"name":"Todd Wolfson","email":"todd@twolfson.com","url":"http://twolfson.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/twolfson/pixelsmith/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"yakun.cyk":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"59c82884-7fd2\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 21:49:56 GMT","_cached":true}
